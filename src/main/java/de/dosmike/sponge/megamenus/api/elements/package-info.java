/**
 * The M??? classes in this package implementing {@link de.dosmike.sponge.megamenus.api.elements.concepts.IElement}
 * can be seen as example. Those classes are primarily marked final, because it's super
 * easy to miss having to expand the copy() function with added information.<br>
 * If you need to implement custom behaviours/elements, feel free to copy a M-Class source into
 * one of your packages and modify it to your liking. Just don't forget to properly implement all methods.
